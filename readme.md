# Project #1

## Make a game!

### Overview

# For this project, I chose to do create a trivia game.  I had in mind meeting our project deliverables and keeping the code very simple.  I also considered the flow of the game from the point of view of the user and wanted to create a fun game.

# The gameplay rules are simple (and I added a "Rules" page to outline them): there is only one category, right now: Science Fiction.  The player will be asked 4 questions.  Two incorrect answers lose the game, while three correct answers win it.

# Visually, I created a "Start" button that the user clicks to begin the game.  A popup appears to welcome the player to the game. It was my intention to have the Science Fiction category be hidden until the popup is closed.  I continue to work on that.

# The game then takes the player through a series of popup prompts that tracks their answers.  The game ends with an announcement based on winning or losing.
